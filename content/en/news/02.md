Jointly with Center Korzhenevskogo, QBT has developed the distributed payment-processing platform (QDP) for industry customers 

>The new processing uses distributed ledger technology (blockchain), which significantly increases its security. In the DLT system, copies of the registry are stored simultaneously by many users, speeding up the parallel execution of transactions and reducing the risk of failures. 

The distributed payment-processing system allows to keep track of game data and virtual currencies, bookmaker rates and bank transfers, carry out transfers with deductible fees, and recognize clearing payments within branches and between financial institutions. In its essence, QDP is a perfectly functioning private blockchain offering the possibility to share digital assets within large ecosystems.

The platform has already been tested and is ready to be commercialized. QDP will serve as a core of blockchain startups at the interface of real financial institutes and new dynamic business models.
