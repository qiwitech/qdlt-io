    text: "QIWI Blockchain Technologies devised a technical concept for the platform, which was incorporated into the white paper. The kernel of the platform is Corda, a blockchain network aggregating partner lenders and managing loan applications (equal and timely access for all partner banks to incoming requests and information on potential customers) and their processing (aggregating loan offers in private torrents between the platform and its partners), in addition to managing CRET tokens used in every transaction on the platform.
