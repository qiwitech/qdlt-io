    title: "About"
    text: "Our experts jointly with Center Korzhenevskogo developed a new platform for distributed processing. The QDP (QIWI Distributed Processing) platform uses open-source software and is based on distributed ledger technology (blockchain), which greatly enhances its safety and lowers maintenance costs. Dmitri Apollonov and Petr Kalambet oversaw the project on our part. Yuri Korzenevski was Project Leader.

The platform has already been tested and is ready to be commercialized. QDP will serve as a core of blockchain startups at the interface of real financial institutes and new dynamic business models.

    title: "Advantages"
    text: "The unique feature of the system is a hybrid combination of classical processing and a chain of transactions, which eliminates the problem of data loss and failure to process a transaction due to an outdated last transaction from the sender's account. Blockchain technology will also boost both the speed of transactions and their efficiency: In the DLT system, copies of the registry are stored simultaneously by many users, significantly reducing failure risks.
</p><p>
A flexible and open architecture of the platform gives it a competitive edge in dynamic financial systems. Non-tied to the Russian market, the platform may claim its share in the global market for services.
