    text: "The technology reduces the involvement of middlemen, ensures the information is available to all interested parties when changes are made, and handles controlled transfer or exchange of property rights for financial instruments and assets while making all the necessary records. 
</p><p>
In compliance with the regulatory provisions of the Russian law, the distributed registry does not store data that is subject to special storage conditions (protected by trade secret, personal data, etc.), does not require trusted intermediaries, does not contain a single point of failure, supports smart contracts, and has a scaling feature by the number of participants and transactions. The communications between the nodes of the network are based on the modified Ethereum protocol.
